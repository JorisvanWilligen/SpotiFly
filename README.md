# Spotifly

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.0.

To try this project:
npm install 
ng serve

Set your own clientID and redirect URL in environment.ts
Do not forget to also set the redirect URL in the developer dashboard of Spotify.

The fastest way to test this is to not change anything.
But then you will need to login using the credentials of my spam account:
